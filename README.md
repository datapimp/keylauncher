# Keylauncher.js

Keylauncher is a library that allows you to embed 'secret' keyboard combinations into your website, that when
entered will trigger the loading of external javascript and css dependencies and, upon loading these dependencies, 
the execution of application launch code.

I use this library to embed small single purpose javascript widgets and applications inside of many websites I have built.

An example is as an app which takes a screenshot of the current webpage with a bug on it, and submits a github issue with that data.
